According to him, the government’s priority at the moment is to ‘raise the floor’ by providing a powerful social network for the less fortunate and ‘raise the ceiling’ by reforming the industry and economic structure of the country despite the challenges of fiscal limitations. He said the government will also strengthen the social protection system through the Social Protection Reform which is being studied to improve its efficiency and effectiveness. The Prime Minister said the cash assistance and the Rahmah programme would continue to ensure that the social safety net continues to be improved. Through the Malaysia MADANI concept, he said the government intends to guarantee the well-being of the people in a more comprehensive manner and not only focus on the economic aspects and income of the people alone. Anwar said the government is also concerned about the spiritual development of the people and always supports efforts to develop praiseworthy personalities. “The government is also proactive in organising religious discourse together with famous scholars and academicians,” he said.",
