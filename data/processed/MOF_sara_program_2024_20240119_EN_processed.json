The payments are scheduled on 19 February 2024 (Monday) and 12 August 2024 (Monday) to the recipient’s bank account or handed out in cash at Bank Simpanan Nasional’s (BSN) branches nationwide.\n\nFollowing the encouraging response to the SARA programme last year, the Government has also expanded the network of participating retailers (supermarkets/sundry shops) to 515 (as at 17 January 2024) from 424 (in 2023) across the nation.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance wishes to advise SARA recipients to be wary of unverified links from irresponsible parties when looking for information on the SARA programme.\n\nFrequently asked questions (FAQ) and review of eligibility status for SARA are available only on STR’s Official Portal at https://bantuantunai.hasil.gov.my from 4:00PM, 19 January 2024, while further details on SARA’s implementation mechanism can be found at https://www.mykasih.com.my on 22 January 2024.\n\nMinistry of Finance\nPutrajaya\n19 January 2024\n\n=================================================\nEND OF DOCUMENT\n=================================================",
