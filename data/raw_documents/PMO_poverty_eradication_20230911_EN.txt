KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 11 — A total of RM1.5 billion has been approved to mobilise programmes and projects capable of generating income for target groups in ensuring the well-being of the people, said Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim.

He said the government vowed to eradicate hardcore poverty this year, regardless of their ethnic background or where they come from.

“Immediate steps will be taken to eradicate poverty by empowering the vulnerable group through the creation of various job opportunities and strengthening social protection.

“As of Aug 15, 2023, the government is still struggling to lift nearly 114,000 hardcore poor families out of poverty,” he said when tabling the 12th Malaysia Plan (12MP) Mid-Term Review (MTR) at the Dewan Rakyat today.

The Prime Minister said the government has also launched the People’s Income Initiative (IPR), a two-pronged initiative that focuses on household income and solving economic structural issues where as of Aug 31, a total of 106,492 applications have been received to participate in the programme.

Anwar said various poverty eradication programmes and initiatives are being implemented by the government, including the Urban Community Economic Empowerment Programme, the People’s Wellbeing Development Scheme for rural residents and the Orang Asli Economic Development Programme.

The government also implements the Special Programme for Sarawak Bumiputera and the Special Programme for Sabah Natives to increase the income of the local community.

“For ethnic Chinese and Indians with low incomes, several initiatives will continue to be implemented in Kampung Baru Cina and as highlighted in the Malaysian Indian Blueprint. For this purpose, the Malaysian Indian Transformation Unit (MITRA) will be empowered to support the socio-economic development of the Indian community in a more coordinated manner,” said Anwar.

According to him, the government’s priority at the moment is to ‘raise the floor’ by providing a powerful social network for the less fortunate and ‘raise the ceiling’ by reforming the industry and economic structure of the country despite the challenges of fiscal limitations.

He said the government will also strengthen the social protection system through the Social Protection Reform which is being studied to improve its efficiency and effectiveness.

The Prime Minister said the cash assistance and the Rahmah programme would continue to ensure that the social safety net continues to be improved.

Through the Malaysia MADANI concept, he said the government intends to guarantee the well-being of the people in a more comprehensive manner and not only focus on the economic aspects and income of the people alone.

Anwar said the government is also concerned about the spiritual development of the people and always supports efforts to develop praiseworthy personalities.

“The government is also proactive in organising religious discourse together with famous scholars and academicians,” he said.

The Prime Minister said that through the main shift in the cultivation of MADANI Society, the formation of MADANI society will be carried out based on the understanding of Maqasid Syariah, moral and spiritual principles, which includes efforts to instill moral and character values in the public service and education sector and institutionalise social research.

According to him, all ongoing programmes and trainings would ensure a basic understanding of Islam for Muslims and emphasise on aspects of values, culture and morals for the people as a whole.
